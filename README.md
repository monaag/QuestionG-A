Question Generation and Answering Project


1] Dataset => using any text or official dataset like SQuAD.                                                                                                             
2] Clean the text from pun, spaces, nums...                                                                                                                               
3] Use a 6 different KeyPhrase techniques.                                                                                                                               
4] Count the unique extracted keywords.                                                                                                                                   
5] Sentence Mapping.  -----> Now the data is ready.                                                                                                                       
6] For Question generation:                                                                                                                                              
  a- T5 model.                                                                                                                                                      
  b- Haystack model.                                                                                                                                                 
7] For Question Answering:                                                                                                                                               
	a- T5 model.                                                                                                                                                           
	b- Haystack model.                                                                                                                                                     
	c- Allen NLP model for both T5 & Haystack questions.
